# Php-Web-App
A fairly generic, full-stack web application which utilizes php on the application server-side in order to communicate with a database and display information in tables for the user. The application also has a very basic user login function. 
This application was originally developed to be deployed within an AWS environment. Most styling is handled by Bootstrap.
